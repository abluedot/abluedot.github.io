## And here we go

I'm trying a new way to blog. A little unconventional, but very promising for me since I now can blog through emacs without any problems. Very nice.

It seems like a good way to do so. But still I have not chosen what language I'll use.

However, this blog will be about environment protection and thoughts about how to reduce the carbon footprint with, not against, using new technologies.

Let's see how and if this is evolving into something useful for you.

Have a lot of fun!
